# refract-challenge

##Description
Horiseon is a business that provides information for businesses in order to increase visibilty and reputation by optimizing thge business' brand for search engines, managing their reputations, and marketing through social media. This project is a refractor challenge where I took the business Horiseon's webpage and made it more accessible to visitors and search engines as well as for future developers to read and understand the code. Horiseon wanted their webpage to be more accessible in order to optimize it for search engines. I made the webpoage more accessible by adding alt text for every image and icon. Ths makes it so that even differently ableded people will be able to access the information from this webpage as well as provides better image context and descriptions to search engines. I made the code more accessibel to future developers by using semantic elements in the HTML so that it is clearer what section of the HTML corresponds with what section of the webpage. I also consolidated classes within the CSS style sheet in order to reduce redundancy of having multiple classes that add the same styling. During this project I have learned about new semantic elements in HTML and how to use them appropriately. I also learned to use CSS to create clasess/IDs and how to use them propertly.
