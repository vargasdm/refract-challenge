# refractor-challenge

##Description

The purpose of this project is to make our clients webpage more accessible for the user, search engines, and for future developers to read and understand the code. Horiseon wanted their webpage to be more accessible in order to optimize it for search engines. I made the webpoage more accessible by adding alt text for every image and icon. This makes it so that even differently ableded people will be able to access the information from this webpage as well as provides better image context and descriptions to search engines. I made the code more accessible to future developers by using semantic elements in the HTML so that it is clearer what section of the HTML corresponds with what section of the webpage. I also consolidated classes within the CSS style sheet in order to reduce redundancy of having multiple classes that add the same styling and added comments.

I learned about code during this refractoring project is:, semantic elements, linking CSS styling code in HTML, classes and ID's and how to use them propertly, using alt attribute to add text, how to utilize commenting, and how to make code more DRY.
